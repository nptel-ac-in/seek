Summary: Unreliable clicking of keys, intense pain in hands after 2 days of typing (I don't bottom out).

Sometimes I hear the click without the key event showing up on screen

Sometimes I see double characters on screen.

Apart from that, the "clicks" are too strong  (the vibrations, not the sound) and are making my finger bones pain after 2 days of using this keyboard. I have very good posture and have been using cherry mx blues for over 5 years now, this problem has never come earlier. The last problem is the major issue, otherwise I could have lived with it.
